# Introdution

* Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. This standard provides assurance that:
* The rights, safety, well-being, and confidentiality of trial participants are protected.
* The data collected in clinical trials as well as the reported results of clinical trials are credible and accurate.
* The current system of Good Clinical Practice has evolved, in part, in response to revelations of past episodes in which research participants were grossly abused.
* The Good Clinical Practice guidelines provide a framework for the fair, scientifically sound conduct of research studies involving human participants. Therefore, all trials should be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all research staff should be trained and remain current in GCP.
* All key personnel who submit applications to the National Institutes of Health for competing or noncompeting projects that involve human research participants must receive training in the protection of human research participants.
* The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the codification (systematic arrangement) of rules published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the U.S. Government. The principles of Good Clinical Practice are codified in several sections, or titles, of the CFR. Noncompliance with these regulations may result in suspension of a research study as well as fines and penalties.
* Countries, states, cities, and institutions may implement additional policies for the protection of human participants. These policies may impose requirements more stringent than those set down in federal regulations. Where more stringent local policies on human participant protection have been enacted, researchers must ensure at all times that their studies are designed and conducted in a manner that complies with both local and federal requirements.

# Institutional Review Boards(IRB)
- The purpose of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of all human research participants.
- Any federally funded research involving human participants must be reviewed and approved by an IRB.
- Any clinical investigation involving a product regulated by the FDA must be reviewed and approved by an IRB.
- The purpose of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of all human research participants.
- Any federally funded research involving human participants must be reviewed and approved by an IRB.
- Any clinical investigation involving a product regulated by the FDA must be reviewed and approved by an IRB.
- An IRB has the authority to approve or disapprove all research activities that fall within its jurisdiction. It may disapprove a research project with a request for modification. It also has the authority to suspend a research study that it previously approved.
- All previously approved ongoing research must be reviewed by an IRB at least once a year to determine whether approval should be continued.
- Every institution, including in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN), that participates in a clinical study must identify all IRBs that have jurisdiction to review and approve the protocol.
- To approve a research protocol, the IRB must ensure that:
  -  Risks to participants are minimized.
  - Risks to participants are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
  - Selection of participants is equitable.
  - Informed consent is properly obtained and documented.
  - Adequate provision is made for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of participants.
  - Adequate provision is made to protect participants and maintain confidentiality of data.
  - Additional safeguards are included for vulnerable populations.
# Informed consent
- Informed consent is a process by which a person voluntarily agrees to participate in a research study after being fully informed about it.
- The informed consent document should contain all of the information that the participant needs to make an informed decision about participating in the study.
- The participant’s signature on the informed consent document confirms his or her voluntary agreement to take part in the study.
- The general requirements for informed consent in federally funded research are spelled out in 45 CFR 46.116 and 21 CFR 50.20. Some states have enacted requirements for informed consent that go beyond federal regulations.
- All researchers have a responsibility to ensure that the process of obtaining informed consent or assent from study participants not only conforms to federal, state, and local regulations but also respects each individual’s right to make an informed decision voluntarily.
- The first step in the process of informed consent is preparing the consent document and supporting documents for presentation to the Institutional Review Board that must review and approve the study and consent document. The IRB must review and approve the consent document before the study can begin.
- Consent documents should be written in nontechnical language that the proposed participants would understand. The language should be consistent with the proposed participants’ educational level, cultural views, and familiarity with research.
- The information that must be provided in an informed consent document is specified in 45 CFR 46.116, 21 CFR 50.20, and ICH GCP 4.8.10.
- The legal age for consent in most states is 18; persons under age 18 are considered minors. Additional protections for children involved as participants in research are set forth in 45 CFR 46 Subpart D. In most cases, both parents must provide permission and the child himself or herself must assent to the child’s participation in research.
- If a person is unable to provide informed consent, a legal representative may give permission for the individual to participate in research in some circumstances. Only one person gives consent. If the participant is capable and is not court ordered legally incompetent, then he or she should sign. If the participant is not capable or is legally incompetent, then the legal representative or guardian should sign. A child and the parents sign, but minor children assent, parents provide permission, and legal guardians consent.
- Participants must not be coerced or unduly influenced. Coercion occurs if an individual perceives that he or she could be harmed or punished for refusing to take part in a study. In some cases, coercion may occur subtly and unintentionally.
- The value of an incentive for participation in a study should not be so high that it could be considered an undue influence on an individual’s decision to participate.
- It is important to ensure that the process of obtaining informed consent from human participants is carried out carefully and with vigilant attention to every detail. Failure to comply with general requirements for informed consent (45 CFR 46.116) and documentation of informed consent (45 CFR 46.117) may result in suspension of a study as well as fines and penalties.

# Confidentiality & Privacy
- Federal law and regulations protect the confidentiality of participant records. In addition, Federal law protects the confidentiality of identifiable health information for all research participants.
- In general, all records of the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of any person that are maintained in connection with alcohol or drug abuse prevention, education, training, treatment, rehabilitation, or research must be kept confidential.
- The regulations identify certain exceptions to the confidentiality requirements. Information in a participant's medical record can be disclosed:
- To people performing duties related to the participant's diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment of alcohol or drug abuse.
- To law enforcement officers when the participant has committed, or threatened to commit, a crime on program premises or against program staff.
- When reporting suspected child abuse or neglect to state or local authorities.
- To medical personnel in a medical emergency.
- For research purposes, with certain conditions.
- For management audits, financial audits, or program evaluation.
- If a participant is found to be at risk for suicide or if he or she makes a credible threat to harm another person.
- When the participant has a communicable disease that poses a risk to public health.
- When authorized by a court order.
- When required by state law.
- If a program discontinues operation or is acquired by another program, there are certain medical record responsibilities that must be followed regarding the clinical records. Each site Principal Investigator must be aware of the procedures and retention period requirements for medical and study related records established by the sponsor and regulatory entities with oversight authority.
- A Certificate of Confidentiality provides an additional level of protection for the privacy of participants involved in research studies.
- Except under certain conditions, a researcher who has obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality cannot be compelled to identify research participants in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding.
- Participants must be told that a research project has been granted a Certificate of Confidentiality.
- The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects all individually identifiable health information that is held or transmitted by covered entities and their business associates. The information may be in any form (e.g., paper, electronic, oral). The Privacy Rule calls this information protected health information (PHI). A covered entity may not use or disclose PHI except as permitted or required by the Privacy Rule.
- Covered entities may use or disclose the “minimum necessary” amount of PHI to or among themselves, without the individual's authorization, for purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations.
- PHI may be disclosed for research purposes when the disclosure is authorized by the research participant. Authorization for disclosures is obtained routinely from participants during the informed consent process. Treatment programs do not need to keep track of disclosures that are authorized by the participant.
- Health information that has been de-identified by the removal of all elements that could identify an individual is no longer considered PHI and is not subject to the Privacy Rule.

# Participant Safety & Adverse Events
The safety and well-being of study participants must be safeguarded at all times during the conduct of a clinical research study.
An adverse event (AE) is defined in the Good Clinical Practice guidelines as any “untoward medical occurrence” in a person who receives a drug while participating in a clinical study. The occurrence need not be causally related to the drug treatment.
For behavioral studies, an AE may be defined as “any unfavorable, unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome, or disease that occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or—if present at baseline—appears to worsen.”
An AE is considered serious if it poses a threat to the patient’s life or functioning. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a serious adverse event (SAE) as any untoward medical occurrence that:
Results in death, or
Life threatening (places the patient at risk of death), or
Requires hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization, or
Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
Requires medical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.
The Investigator in a behavioral trial may modify or expand the FDA criteria for an SAE to reflect the specific risks of the intervention and the characteristics of the study population.
The severity of an AE is not the same as its seriousness. An adverse event may be severe (e.g., severe pain from a toothache) without being serious (threatening the patient’s life or functioning).
SAEs must be reported by phone or fax immediately to all parties notified as specified in the protocol.
The purpose of expedited reporting to the FDA or other regulatory authority is to ensure that the appropriate parties—including investigators, sponsors, regulators, and IRBs—are quickly made aware of new, important information about the potential adverse effects of a drug or other experimental intervention.
In addition to reporting AEs and SAEs, NIH-funded studies are required to report unanticipated problems that affect the safety of study participants and others. While unanticipated problems are found in and regulated by 45 CFR 46, OHRP provides the criteria for determining unanticipated problems and the reporting and review of these incidents (see OHRP, 2007).
Generally, all AEs and SAEs should be followed up until they have resolved or stabilized.
Data and safety monitoring must occur periodically throughout every study to protect participant safety and ensure the integrity of study data, for example, by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board for a clinical trial.

# Quality Assurance
-Quality Assurance (QA) consists of planned, systematic activities conducted to ensure that a trial is performed―and that trial data are generated, documented, and reported―in compliance with the protocol and with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all other applicable regulatory requirement(s).
QA is the responsibility of every member of the research team. The role of QA staff is to support and assist members of the research team in adhering to high quality standards.
The purposes of monitoring are to verify that:
The rights and well-being of human participants are protected.
Reported trial data are attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete.
The trial is conducted in compliance with the currently approved protocol (including any amendments), as well as with GCP and all other applicable regulatory requirement(s).
Monitoring can occur on-site and/or remotely (via centralized monitoring), and it is required before, during, and after completion of a trial.

# The Research Protocol
Standardization of procedures is critical in a clinical research study. Research that is not conducted in a standardized manner is unethical because it may put research participants at risk while yielding invalid data.
All research staff involved in a clinical study must be familiar with, and must strictly adhere to, the procedures described in the research protocol.
The research protocol is one of the main documents that must be approved by a designated Institutional Review Board before a research study can begin. The research protocol provides a plan for the essential aspects of the proposed research.
The Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization require a research protocol for any study that involves human participants. In addition, Title 21 Part 312 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires a research protocol for studies conducted under an Investigational New Drug application.
A protocol amendment is a change to some aspect of the study. Amendments must be approved by the IRB before they can be implemented, unless there is an immediate safety concern for participants. If the study is to be submitted to the FDA, such as being under an IND, the amendment must be submitted to the FDA as well as to the IRB.
A protocol violation occurs whenever any study staff member performs any action that does not adhere to the study description in the research protocol. Each violation must be documented and action must be taken to correct the situation that led to the violation. Repeated protocol violations may indicate the need for additional staff training or a protocol amendment.

# Documentation & Record-Keeping
Every aspect of a clinical study must be documented in order to obtain useful data and demonstrate compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards and with all applicable regulations.
GCP guidelines specify the essential documents that must be maintained for every clinical study. These documents are classified according to whether they are normally created before a study begins, while a study is in progress, or after a study is completed or terminated.
Federal regulations require investigators to retain records for 2 years after approval of the investigational drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or for 2 years after the study is discontinued and FDA is notified.
Sponsors may require specific documentation in addition to the list of essential documents specified by GCP.
Source documents are original documents created during a clinical study, from which study data are obtained. The purpose of source documents is to document the existence of study participants and substantiate the integrity of the study data collected.
Progress notes document participants’ involvement in the study and the study–related care they receive. Progress notes are used to monitor the progress of the study and substantiate the data recorded in the case report forms (CRFs).
The purpose of CRFs is to gather study data in a standardized format so that the data can be entered into a computerized database and analyzed. All of the information needed to complete the data analyses used to assess the outcomes of the study is recorded in the CRFs.

# Research Misconduct
Federal policy defines research misconduct as “fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.” This definition does not include honest error or differences of opinion or authorship disputes unless they involve plagiarism.
Federal policy on research misconduct applies to all federally funded research and all proposals submitted to federal agencies for research funding.
The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) in the Department of Health and Human Services oversees investigations of research misconduct allegations and makes final determinations on findings of research misconduct within the U.S. Public Health Service.
Federal policy places the primary responsibility for reporting and investigating allegations of research misconduct with researchers and research institutions.
Generally, the response to an allegation of research misconduct has three stages:
Inquiry (to assess the facts of the allegation).
Investigation (if the inquiry provides adequate basis for one).
Adjudication (imposing of suitable penalties if the allegation is found to have merit).
Penalties for research misconduct may include termination of employment, suspension or termination of a research grant, and suspension or debarment from receiving federal funds.

# Roles & Responsibilities
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines specifically define the responsibilities of the Sponsor and Principal Investigator of a clinical study.
The ultimate responsibility for the quality and integrity of the trial data always resides with the Sponsor although some obligations of the sponsor maybe delegated to a partner organization or contract research organization (CRO).
The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for the conduct of a clinical study at a research site and retains ultimate responsibility even if specific tasks are delegated to other site research staff.

# Recruitment & Retention
Recruitment and retention of participants are key to the success of any clinical study.
A successful recruitment and retention strategy requires informed and detailed planning, commitment of adequate resources, careful monitoring, and timely identification and resolution of problems.
Recruitment of participants may not begin until the Institutional Review Board (IRB) has approved the protocol, informed consent documents, and proposed recruitment and retention strategies.
Advertisements, fliers, and brochures that are prepared to recruit potential participants and inform them about a study are considered part of the informed consent process. As such, they must be reviewed and approved by the IRB (see ICH GCP 3.1.2).
Recruitment for a study has two major elements:
Defining a population of appropriate participants to answer the research question.
Recruiting appropriate participants in an ethical manner.
Recruitment of an adequate number of participants, although essential, does not in itself assure the success of a study. Unless an adequate number of participants are retained for the duration of the study, investigators will not obtain enough data to answer the research question they posed, which was the reason for performing the study in the first place.
Research participants may be offered rewards such as monetary payments or medical care at no cost. Such rewards are not considered benefits of study participation but rather incentives for participation.
Because incentives for participation are potentially coercive, the amount, form, and conditions of such incentives must be reviewed and approved by the IRB (see ICH GCP 3.1.8).

# Investigational New Drugs
ICH GCP refers to an Investigational Product as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial.
In FDA regulations, an investigational new drug is any substance (such as a drug, vaccine, or biological product) for which FDA approval is being sought.
A drug may be considered “new” even if it has been in use for years if a change is proposed in its use, formulation, route of administration, or packaging.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial that involves an investigational new drug must submit an Investigational New Drug application (IND) to the FDA. Lawfully marketed drugs are exempt from the IND regulations if they meet certain criteria.
Behavioral studies (like the ones conducted in the CTN) are not subject to investigational new drug regulations. Moreover, certain medication studies may be IND-exempt. It is important, nonetheless, that all researchers understand these regulations. The principle that research participants should not be exposed to experimental interventions unnecessarily, in an unsafe manner, or in a manner that fails to protect their rights is equally applicable to all studies involving human participants.
