* Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. This standard provides assurance that:
* The rights, safety, well-being, and confidentiality of trial participants are protected.
* The data collected in clinical trials as well as the reported results of clinical trials are credible and accurate.
* The current system of Good Clinical Practice has evolved, in part, in response to revelations of past episodes in which research participants were grossly abused.
* The Good Clinical Practice guidelines provide a framework for the fair, scientifically sound conduct of research studies involving human participants. Therefore, all trials should be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all research staff should be trained and remain current in GCP.
* All key personnel who submit applications to the National Institutes of Health for competing or noncompeting projects that involve human research participants must receive training in the protection of human research participants.
* The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the codification (systematic arrangement) of rules published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the U.S. Government. The principles of Good Clinical Practice are codified in several sections, or titles, of the CFR. Noncompliance with these regulations may result in suspension of a research study as well as fines and penalties.
* Countries, states, cities, and institutions may implement additional policies for the protection of human participants. These policies may impose requirements more stringent than those set down in federal regulations. Where more stringent local policies on human participant protection have been enacted, researchers must ensure at all times that their studies are designed and conducted in a manner that complies with both local and federal requirements.
